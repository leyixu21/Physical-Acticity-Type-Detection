# Physical-Acticity-Type-Detection
The course project physical activity type (PAT) detection is a group project with three group members. This project developed machine learning models to classify PATs based on data from GPS sensors and accelerometers. Artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to detect six PATs (Lying, Sitting, Standing, Non-level Walking, Walking, Running) of younger and older adults separately using PyTorch. The transferability of PTA detection models across different age groups was also examined.

## Data
Three uTrail devices were mounted on the left and right hips. The uTrail is a small wearable device that includes an audio sensor, an accelerometer, and a GPS sensor [[1]](#1). This project used data collected by GPS sensors and accelerometers.

- Positions of uTrail devices on the participants' body.

- Information recorded by the uTrail device.
